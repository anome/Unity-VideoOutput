 If you implement your own subclass of SyphonServerBase, you must call this designated initializer from your own initializer.

 Creates a new server with the specified human-readable name (which need not be unique), CGLContext and options. The server will be started immediately. Init may fail and return nil if the server could not be started.

 @param serverName Non-unique human readable server name. This is not required and may be nil, but is usually used by clients in their UI to aid identification.
 @param options A dictionary containing key-value pairs to specify options for the server. Currently supported options are SyphonServerOptionIsPrivate, plus any added by the subclass. See their descriptions for details.
 @returns A newly intialized Syphon server. Nil on failure.

 A dictionary describing the server. Normally you won't need to access this, however if you created the server as private (using SyphonServerOptionIsPrivate) then you must pass this dictionary to any process in which you wish to create a SyphonClient. You should not rely on the presence of any particular keys in this dictionary. The content will always conform to the \<NSCoding\> protocol.
